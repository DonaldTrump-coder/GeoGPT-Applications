# GeoGPT-Applications
## An Intelligent Decision-Making System on Drones based on Large Models
## 基于大模型的无人机智能决策系统
A decision-making system using on the virtual drone based on the UE4 (Unreal Engine 4.27) and its plug-in Airsim 1.2. Connected to a VLM(any Vision-Language Model) and a LLM(GeoGPT), the system can help control the drone with the images it takes, constructing an embodied intelligent agent.
