# GeoGPT-Applications
## An Intelligent Decision-Making System on Drones based on Large Models
## 基于大模型的无人机智能决策系统
A decision-making system using on the virtual drone based on the UE4 (Unreal Engine 4.27) and its plug-in Airsim 1.2. Connected to a VLM(any Vision-Language Model) and a LLM(GeoGPT), the system can help control the drone with the images it takes, constructing an embodied intelligent agent.
If you can make use of it in your own research or development, please be so kind to cite us.
